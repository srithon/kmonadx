#+title: Planned Features

* Lists as LValues
When you want to bind multiple keys to the same rvalue, it would be nice to be able to do it in one line.
#+begin_src toml
# assign both the left control and caps lock keys to speed-down
# we use curly braces because square brackets are already taken by the TOML syntax
{lctl, caps} = speed-down
#+end_src

* Layer References
It would be nice to be able to reference the current layer name (at compilation time), for instance when creating ~enter~ and ~exit~ buttons.
#+begin_src toml
[scroll.arrow-keys]
[[public]]
# &layer resolves to `scroll.arrow-keys` based on context
enter = (layer-add &layer)
[[private]]
exit = (layer-rem &layer)
#+end_src
